Matt's IDL Code Notes

1. Doppler Width: Due to doppler broadening, moving atoms appear to absorb/emit Doppler-shifted photons from our reference frame --> results in emission and absorption line broadening. Effect increases with higher star temperatures

2. Collisional Frequency: Will subtly alter the spectra through the Doppler width (Matt??), appears to be a component of Lorentz broadening 

Lorentz broadening is a combination of natural line broadening and collisional broadening

Note: natural broadening --> arises from the uncertainty in energy of the states involved in the transition (uncertainty priciple)

3. line 105: Rybicki & Lightman p. 291: 
Calculating the Voigt Function: combines the Lorentz profile PLUS the Doppler effect (all factors that contribute to broadening). Produces Voigt profile that is a line profile of the convolution of the two Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening mechanisms. 

Note: a and u are variables in the Voigt profile that depend on atom velocity, etc. 

4. line 201: Limb Darkening using Carroll & Ostlie Eddington Approximation Method (p.266): 
Approximation for intensity as a function of angle $\theta$ from the normal

Notes from Meeting:

Things to do: find a theoretical study with equations that dictate how stellar spots/plage travel towards the the star's equator over time 

matt used the impact parameter to graph the RV curve
"fractional spot size would be good"

"butterfly diagram" spot migrations towards the equator seems to depend on stellar age
